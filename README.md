This repository contains all the files created during the learning phase of the
C programming language.

Several resources were consumed during this process.

Nothing in here is meant to serve any real purpose to anyone other than myself
and it also does not adhere to the best practices of the language.

This is kept on github only as a means of reference for me who understands what
is going on in totality. It has been a public repo just in case somebody
somehow were able to find it useful.

Peace!
